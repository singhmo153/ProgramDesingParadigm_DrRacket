;; PURPOSE : To write the function that returns product of all the numbers
;;           in a list.

;;******************************FUNCTION************************************


;; product : List -> Number
    ;; GIVEN : a list of numbers
    ;; RETURNS : product of all the numbers in the given list.
    ;; Examples: 
    ;; (product empty) = 0
    ;; (product (list 1)) = 1
    ;; (product (list 1 2 3) = 6
