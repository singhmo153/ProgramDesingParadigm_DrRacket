;; PURPOSE : To design a function that takes a list of lists of strings as an 
;;           argument that treats each of the lists of strings as a line in a
;;           text and renders the whole text as an image.

;; stringdisp : listOfStrings -> Image
    ;; GIVEN : a list of strings
    ;; RETURNS : a string that contains all strings in the list searated 
    ;;           spaces.
    ;; Examples: 
    ;; (stringdisp (list "Hi" "John")) = Hi John
