#| Purpose: To define a function called tip that takes two arguments, a number
            representing the amount of a bill in dollars, and a decimal number
            between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the percentage of a tip one wants
            to give. tip should return the amount of tip in dollars.|#

;*****************************FUNCTION*****************************************

;tip : NonNegNumber Number[0.0,1.0] -> Number
;GIVEN: the amount of the bill in dollars and the
;percentage of tip
;RETURNS: the amount of the tip in dollars.
;Examples:
;(tip 10 0.15) => 1.5
;(tip 20 0.17) => 3.4

(define (tip a p)
  (* a p))
